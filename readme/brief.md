In this project, youâ€™ll be building a frontend-only website using the technologies that you have learned throughout Interactive Frontend Development. You can either choose to use one of the three example briefs below, or you can use your idea for the website.

# CREATE A SINGLE PAGE APPLICATION THAT RELIES HEAVILY ON ONE OR MORE APIS
Create a site that calls on the Google Maps API and/or the Google Places API (or similar) to allow users to search for their next holiday destination. You'll want help your users:

* Select a destination city

* Find tourist attractions

* Find accommodation

* Find bars and restaurants

Provide search results in a manner that is visually appealing for your user (by drawing on the skills you have learned in User-Centric Frontend Development)

# CREATE A MEMORY GAME
Build a simple single-player memory game inspired by Simon. Check out this short video and Wikipedia entry to understand the rules of the game
Provide details in your `README.md` of the logic you have used to build your game as well as an explanation of how you tested your logic

# CREATE A DATA DASHBOARD
Build a data dashboard that visualizes a dataset of your choice
Your data can be stored locally (e.g., in a js file) or sourced from an API
Visualise your data using D3.js and dc.js

# CREATE YOUR OWN PROJECT
If you choose to create your project, the scope should be similar to that of the example brief above. If you want some ideas, please ask your mentor for advice and direction.
