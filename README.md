# **Interactive Front-End Development Milestone Project**
## **The project idea is of a dashboard representing data about the local Medical Practice**
>This web site is all about providing data about ten different medical clinics.  These data is comprised doctors, nurses and consultant numbers as well as patient counts per day as well as average waiting times for a patient be seen.  The data  is recorded over a one year period for 2017.  
>The clinics each provide similar services and have patients visiting them at different times of the day. This dashboard will allow the user to interact with imaginary data about the clinics, so as to view some interesting statistics but more so, to be able to experience the flexibility of d3 and crossfilter javascript engines running within the browser.
>I have chosen to include a Google maps API with real gps coordinates to to real clinics.  I have done this to provide familiarity for the user, and nothing else.  The data sources are .json files created here.
