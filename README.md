# **Interactive Front-End Development Milestone Project**
## **The project idea is of a dashboard representing data about the local doctor's clinic**
>This web site is all about providing data about ten different local clinics.  In these clinics tare doctors, nurses and consultants.  The clinics each provide similar services and have patients visiting them at different times of the day. This dashboard will allow the user to interact with imaginary data about the clinics, so as to view some interesting statistics but more so, to be able to experience the flexability of d3 and crosfilter javascript engines running within the browser.
>I have chosen to include a Google maps API with real gps coordinates to to real clinics.  Ive done this to profide familiarity for the user, and nothing else.  The data sources are .json files created here.
